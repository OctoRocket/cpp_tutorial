#include <iostream> // #include <iostream> will let you use commands like cout and cin (console output and console input)
using namespace std; // using namespace std; will allow you to use the default functions like variables and iostream with out having to put std:: before everything

void hello_world() // void hello_world() makes a function called hello_world() (functions are just portable code) that won't expect an output (outputs are made with the return command)
{ // start of function
  cout << "Hello World!\n"; // cout << "Hello world!\n"; prints "Hello world!" with a new line at the end (the \n is the new line charicter)
} // end of function
